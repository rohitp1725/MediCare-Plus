## About

MediCare+ is a full-stack health tracking application designed for elderly care. It provides three distinct, role-based dashboards — **Patient**, **Caregiver**, and **Doctor** — each with tailored features and secure, policy-enforced data access.

The platform handles the complete healthcare workflow: medicines are prescribed by caregivers, daily dose logs are auto-generated at midnight via `pg_cron`, patients track their own health vitals and symptoms, and doctors review clinical history and write formal prescriptions — all within a single, secure system.

- Medication adherence reports with visual progress bars
- AI-powered health assistant with wellness guidance

### Caregiver

|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| View own medicines | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add / edit medicines | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Log doses | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Log vitals & symptoms | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Security

All data access is enforced at the database level using **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies. No client-side filtering is relied upon for security.

- Patients can only read and write their own records
- Caregivers can only access records of patients explicitly linked to them
- Doctors can only access records of patients who have accepted their link request
- All links (caregiver ↔ patient, doctor ↔ patient) are established via a verified email-based RPC function

## Automated Jobs

| Job | Trigger | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `generate_dose_logs_for_date` | Daily at midnight (`pg_cron`) | Pre-generates tomorrow's dose log entries for all active medicines |
| `check_adherence_alerts` | Daily at 8 AM (`pg_cron`) | Flags missed doses and creates low-adherence notifications |
| `trg_medicine_generate_dose_logs` | DB trigger on `medicines` insert/update | Immediately creates today's logs when a medicine is activated |
| `trg_patient_conditions_updated_at` | DB trigger on `patient_conditions` update | Keeps `updated_at` timestamps accurate |
